## About 📝

> **[?]** Beautiful Commit is a simple shell scipt based tool that  help you to make beautiful git commit messages

## But, why? 🤷

> **[?]** Git by default requires commit messages because in software development, it is practically necessary to communicate with other people, and the commit message is the best way to communicate a variety of details about the commit, including what it does, why the change is necessary, the benefits and downsides of the change, and why this change is better than alternatives. Communication is an essential skill in the workplace and in open source projects and that is also true for writing ***beautiful*** and ***usefull*** commits.
